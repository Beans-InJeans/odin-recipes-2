    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>Oyster mushrooms</li>
        <li>1.5 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 tbs Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbs fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>5 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large, 
            deep skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, ½ teaspoon 
            of the salt, and several grinds of pepper and toss to coat. 
            Cook, stirring only occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until soft 
            and browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Work in batches 
            if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wipe out the pan and return it to the heat. Add the remaining 2 
            tablespoons olive oil, the onion, and the remaining ¼ teaspoon sea 
            salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until 
            softened. Stir in the garlic, thyme, and rice. Let cook for 1 minute, 
            then add the wine. Stir and cook for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the 
            wine cooks down.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the broth ¾ cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each 
            addition of broth to be absorbed before adding the next. With the final 
            addition of broth, stir two-thirds of the sautéed mushrooms into the 
            risotto. Cook until the risotto is creamy and the rice has a slight al 
            dente bite. Stir in the cheese and season to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with the remaining sautéed mushrooms, garnish with parsley, and serve 
            with more grated cheese, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
